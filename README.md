## About Me

My journey into technology began with a childhood fascination for computers. Despite not studying computer science, my passion led me to delve into web development in December 2022. Self-teaching through resources like Google, YouTube, and the 'Complete Web Development Course With Jhankar Mahbub' by Programming Hero, I've been loving every moment of it!

Specializing in front-end web development, I've mastered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Next.js. I'm still learning and eager to grow my skills to become a full-stack web developer.

My goal is to transition into the professional sphere, where I can apply my expertise to real-world projects and contribute to innovation. With a commitment to excellence and a drive to succeed, I'm excited about making a meaningful impact in the ever-evolving technology landscape.

If given the chance, I'm eager to share what I've learned and continue growing in this dynamic field.

## What I'm Working On

Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of Next.js, exploring its capabilities to build fast and scalable web applications.
