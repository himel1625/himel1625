## About Me

From a childhood fascination with computers to a deep passion for coding, my journey into technology has been driven by curiosity and dedication. Although I didn't pursue a formal education in computer science, I ventured into web development in December 2023, teaching myself through resources like Google, YouTube, and Jhankar Mahbubâ€™s Complete Web Development Course by Programming Hero. Every challenge and success along the way has fueled my enthusiasm and determination.

As a front-end developer, Iâ€™ve specialized in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Next.js. Iâ€™m committed to continuous growth, with the clear goal of expanding my expertise to become a full-stack developer.

Iâ€™m now eager to step into the professional world, where I can apply my skills to real-world projects, drive innovation, and contribute to meaningful solutions. My commitment to excellence, problem-solving mindset, and passion for learning position me to make a significant impact in the dynamic tech landscape.

I believe in the power of collaboration and knowledge sharing. Letâ€™s connect, innovate, and code the future together!
